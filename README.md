Exquisite Corpse is a turn based drawing game traditionally played on paper. To play the original game you draw on the top section of a piece of paper without the other player(s) seeing the drawing. When done drawing you fold back the paper so that the next person can only see a tiny strip of your drawing. The next person continues the drawing (without anyone seeing) and when finished folds it and gives it to the next person and so on. Finally when the whole paper is fileld (with a standard A4 piece of paper this is usually after 3/4 turns) the paper is unfolded and the collaboration is unveiled. Often surprising results. 

In this implementation of the game you draw a section, click 'done', and a link appears which you can then share. The person following your link can continue your drawing and will get another link which can be sent back to you or to a third person. After the third section is done the whole image is reveiled and can be downloaded and shared.
